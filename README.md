# Building EfficientNetV2 from Scratch in Pytorch

For my own study purpose.

## Building the model

Install requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run efficientnetv2.py and you will see the output shape of the model being logged. 

Run `pytest` in the command line to make sure the script is working.
